# STM32F407VG Multi-Slot Bootloader

This project is a custom **multi-slot bootloader** written from scratch for the **STM32F407VG** microcontroller. The bootloader supports selecting one of multiple user applications stored in flash memory based on button input and UART communication at boot.

## üöÄ What is a Bootloader?

A **bootloader** is a small program that runs before any application code starts executing on an embedded device. It is responsible for initializing the system and deciding which application (firmware) to load into execution.

---

## üîß Why Use a Bootloader?

Bootloaders are essential in embedded systems for the following reasons:

- üß© **Application switching:** Enables selecting between different firmware versions or application modes.
- üíæ **Memory management:** Manages flash layout for multiple apps.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Firmware upgrades:** Can be extended to support OTA or serial upgrades.
- üß™ **Testing/debugging:** Easily switch between factory test code, debug code, and production code.
- üßº **Recovery/factory reset:** Restore the default firmware in case of issues.

---

## üì¶ Features

- Support for **3 different applications**:
  - `Default App`
  - `App 1` (User slot)
  - `App 2` (Factory slot)
- **Button-based boot selection** using onboard USER button.
- **UART-based app selection** when button is pressed.
- Times out in 5 seconds and loads `Default App` if no button is pressed.
- Runs entirely on bare-metal STM32F407VG.

## üß† Flash Memory Layout

| Application   | Flash Address (Example) |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| Bootloader    | `0x08000000`            |
| Default App   | `0x08020000`            |
